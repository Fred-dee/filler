# filler
Work done for the Algorithm Module at WeThinkCode_

This project uses work from the <a href = "https://www.github.com/Fred-Dee/get_next_line/"> get_next_line </a> project
as well as the <a href = "https://www.github.com/Fred-Dee/libft/"> libft </a> project/

The aim of the project is to create a "player"/bot that will play against another bot in a game where capturing the most board space is the goal

<h1>Compilation And Execution</h1>
In order to compile the player I've created run Make or Make re command in the root directory
to run the game use the command (from root):
./resources/filler_vm  -f ./resources/maps/map0* -p1 'player location' -p2 ./resources/players/*
<sub>* - select a player/map from that directory</sub>
